CIS TSYP 12 Challenge 

## Project Overview
In this step , thes project consists of two main components:

1. **Jupyter Notebook**: A Python-based notebook that uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to detect a person in an image or video and measure various body dimensions such as height, width, shoulder width, and hand length. The measurements are then saved in a CSV file for further analysis.
   
2. **Unity Application**: A Unity-based application that includes:
   - A camera detection scene to visualize the detected person.
   - An avatar editing scene that allows users to change outfits on a 3D avatar.

## Features
- **Person Detection & Measurement (Jupyter Notebook)**: 
  - Detects a person in an image or video.
  - Measures body attributes: height, width, shoulder width, hand length.
  - Saves the measurements in a CSV file for later use.
  
- **Unity Camera Detection Scene**: 
  - Uses real-time camera input to detect objects/people in the scene using YOLO.
  
- **Avatar Editing Scene**: 
  - Users can change outfits on an avatar in a pre-recorded clothing shop environment.
  - Integration with Ready Player Me for avatar creation.

## Prerequisites
- **Software Requirements**:
  - Unity 2021 or higher
  - Python 3.x
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - OpenCV (for YOLO integration)
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch (for running YOLO model)
  
- **Hardware**:
  - A camera for Unity scene visualization (if using real-time detection).
